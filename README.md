Agentic AI Honeypot System

This project is a prototype of an ethical, sandboxed AI honeypot designed to protect users from digital scams.

Once a scam is detected, the user can hand over the interaction to an AI agent that impersonates a realistic human persona, engages the scammer, and extracts scam-related intelligence for analysis and law enforcement support.

This system does not interact with real users, payments, or live platforms.
